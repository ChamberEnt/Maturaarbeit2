Present
Maverick thinks he has found a connection between the increasing numbers of house robots and the depression of the people in New Babel. He is visiting the RSC headquarter but there he is reassured that there cannot be a connection and that everything concerning the house robots is under control.

Later Maverick is visited by Robert Teller who is asking him for help. He tells Maverick that he was right about the IQ-C9000+ being connected to the increasing cases of depression. The computer has found a way to absorb the “joy of life” through the house robots and it has become addicted to it so it always wants more.\nRobert Teller and Maverick are planning to save the city and Robert Teller knows how: he is going to build a device that can disconnect the IQ-C9000+ from the city’s network and thus stop it from gathering more “joy of life” from the people in it.
